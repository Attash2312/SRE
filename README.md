# SRE Final Exam Notes (Theory + Scenario Based)

## What this repo contains
These notes are written to match your syllabus topics and the style of questions in your past papers (stakeholders, use cases with include/extend, incremental delivery requirements, critique/fix requirements, prioritization calculations, and short theory).

## Files (study order)
0. `00_exam_summary_cheatsheet.md` (last-day revision)
1. `01_chapter1_foundations.md`
2. `02_chapter3to5_models_and_spec.md`
3. `03_requirement_elicitation.md`
4. `04_requirement_analysis_and_negotiation.md`
5. `05_non_functional_requirements.md`
6. `06_requirement_validation.md`
7. `07_agile_methodologies_and_re.md`
8. `08_requirements_management.md`
9. `09_requirements_traceability.md`
10. `10_past_papers_solved.md` (all solved + extra exam-style questions)

## How to prepare quickly (suggested)
- Day 1: Chapters 1 + 3–5 + practice 2 use-case diagrams.
- Day 2: Elicitation + Analysis + NFRs (rewrite 10 bad requirements).
- Day 3: Validation + Agile + Mgmt + Traceability (do solved past paper once).

## Exam patterns to expect (based on your papers)
- Identify stakeholders (internal vs external)
- Draw use-case diagram with `<<include>>` + `<<extend>>` and write 1 use case description
- Write verifiable FRs/NFRs for increment 1
- Criticize bad requirements (ambiguity, amalgamation, unverifiable)
- Do prioritization math (state assumptions clearly)
- Explain validation/review steps + traceability types

## Diagrams
Diagrams are written in Mermaid. If your Markdown viewer doesn’t render Mermaid, open the file in VS Code with a Mermaid-enabled preview.

## Notes about assumptions
Some past paper statements are partially formatted. Where needed, the solved answers explicitly state assumptions (this is acceptable and often expected in scenario questions).
